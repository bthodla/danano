Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity

Objectives
- The primary objective of this repository is to version all the project submission work that I am doing as a part of the Data Analyst Nanodegree with Udacity
- The repository organization is pretty simple - a folder for each project and artifacts related to that project including data files, Jupyter Notebooks and any submissions in PDF/Word format
